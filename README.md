# Student-Dropout-Prediction
This project utilizes various Machine Learning techniques like ike Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees and k-NN to predict student outcomes, specifically focusing on predicting whether a student will graduate (1) or not (0). The goal is to analyze and model student data to provide insights into the likelihood of student dropout and academic performance.

## Overview
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict student outcomes based on various features in the dataset. Several models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and k-nearest Neighbors (k-NN), have been implemented.

## Data Preprocessing and Exploration
1. Handling Missing Data: Identified and appropriately handled null values.
2. Duplicate Data: Ensured data integrity by addressing duplicate records.
3. Statistical Summary: Provided basic statistical summary of the data.
4. Data Visualization: Plotted histograms to visualize the distribution of key features.
